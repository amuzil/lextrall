# Lextrall Font Family

Based on the amazing work by Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin on [Lexend](https://lexend.com), Lextrall adds modern features like small caps and old-style figures for additional utility of the font in modern applications.

## [Lexend](http://lexend.com)

Lexend is a variable typeface designed by Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin in 2018.
Applying the Shaver-Troup Individually Optimal Text Formation Factors, studies have found readers instantaneously improve their reading fluency.

Lexend was expanded to Arabic in July 2021. The Shaver-Troup Formulation was applied to Arabic with advisement from Arabic Typeface Designer, Nadine Chahine.
See <https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro>.

Lexend was turned into a variable font with weight axis (Thin to Black) by Font Bureau in March 2021.

This font is based on the Quicksand project from Andrew Paglinawan, initiated in 2008.
Quicksand was improved in 2016 by Thomas Jockin for Google Fonts. Thomas modified Quicksand for the specialized task of improving reading fluency in low-proficiency readers (including those with dyslexia.)
